Executive Summary

•	Summary of Methodologies
The whole project was based on the use of Python libraries to perform the different stages of the Data Science Project. Thus, Python was used from the data collection with requests and BeautifulSoup and data wrangling with Pandas, all the way to ML models with scikit-learn and dashboards with Plotly Dash, showing how powerful it is as Data Science tool.

•	Summary of all Results
The final results were based on the creation of ML models through which we can evaluate their accuracy to predict if the landing of a launch will be successful or not. To do this task, we pass through the stages of EDA and data visualization in order to get a clearer understanding of the relationships between features and the expected outcome, so we can transmit these insights to our ML models.  
Introduction

Introduction

•	Project Background
Commercial space voyages have become a reality, so the race between companies to domain the market is at its peak. Among the many competitors like Virgin Galactic, Rocket Lab, Blue Origin, etc.; it seems that the one that has positioned itself best is SpaceX. With their Falcon 9 rocket, SpaceX, has achieved to create reusable first stages, which allows them to lower the cost of their launches to 62 million dollars, compared to the 165 million of other companies. 
•	Problematic
As part of the new rocket company SpaceY, we would like to analyze the success that SpaceX has achieved. Therefore, we will analyze the different factors of a rocket launch (location, booster version, payload mass, orbit, etc.), to determine which are the most influential in a successful outcome, so that the first stage can be reused.
